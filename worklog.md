Task ID: 1
Agent: Z.ai Code (main)
Task: Build a new website for Sadia's IELTS (sadiasielts.com), referencing 10minuteschool.com structure

Work Log:
- Researched client site sadiasielts.com via page_reader: extracted courses, pricing (৳), stats (9+ yrs, 316+ batches, 5,983 learners, 17 courses), contact info, blog tips, success story names
- Downloaded client logo (black + gold) → public/sadia-logo.png; confirmed brand identity
- 10minuteschool.com blocked by Cloudflare; used known edtech layout patterns instead
- Generated 3 AI images matching black/gold brand: hero student, instructor portrait (Sadia Rahman), classroom (public/images/)
- Updated prisma/schema.prisma: replaced User/Post demo models with Lead model (name, phone, email, course, message, status); ran db:push
- Redesigned globals.css: premium black & gold theme (#0a0a0c bg, #d4af37 gold primary), custom @utility classes (text-gold-gradient, bg-gold-gradient, bg-radial-glow) — note: Tailwind 4 requires @utility, not @layer utilities
- layout.tsx: Playfair Display (display serif) + Geist + Noto Sans Bengali fonts, SEO metadata for Sadia's IELTS
- Built components (src/components/site/): site-header (sticky, topbar, mobile Sheet), hero (animated, floating badges), stats-strip (count-up counters), courses-section (6 real courses, ৳ pricing, discounts, preselect-on-enroll), skills-section (4 modules, Bengali), why-us-section (classroom image + 4 benefits), tips-section (real blog tricks), stories-section (embla carousel, real student names), instructor-section (Sadia Rahman bio), faq-section (accordion, Bengali), enroll-section (lead form), site-footer (link columns, contact strip)
- Zustand store (enroll-store.ts) lets course cards pre-select the course in the enroll form
- API: POST /api/leads with zod validation, Prisma persistence
- Fixed issues during verification: missing Reveal import; Tailwind 4 @layer utilities → @utility syntax; Radix Sheet useId hydration mismatch → mount-gated Sheet via useSyncExternalStore; lint rule against sync setState in effect → rAF callback
- Verified with agent-browser: hero/courses/skills/why-us/tips/stories/faq/enroll/footer all render; FAQ accordion opens; carousel next works; course Enroll preselects form; form submission → 201 + lead persisted in DB (verified via Prisma query); invalid API input → 400 with field issues; mobile 390px layout + mobile menu work; footer sits flush at page bottom; zero console/server errors

Stage Summary:
- Complete single-page marketing site for Sadia's IELTS in brand black/gold, bilingual (English + Bengali)
- Real client data used throughout (courses, prices, stats, tips, testimonials, contacts)
- Working lead capture: form → POST /api/leads → SQLite (Lead table)
- All interactions browser-verified; lint clean; no hydration or runtime errors
